## 1. Preliminary Setup

### 1.1. Install qBittorrent
- Download and install the latest version of [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) for Windows.

### 1.2. Configure Windows Firewall
- Ensure that Windows Firewall is enabled on your public network.
- Open **Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Allowed apps** and add qBittorrent if it isn’t already listed. This allows the necessary incoming connections for BitTorrent.

## 2. Configure ProtonVPN Settings

### 2.1. Note on Port Forwarding with ProtonVPN
ProtonVPN does not support traditional port forwarding. Instead, you may need to rely on UPnP (if enabled) or configure your local firewall/router settings to ensure qBittorrent communicates properly.

### 2.2. Connect to ProtonVPN
- Launch the ProtonVPN client and connect to your desired server.

### 2.3. Configure qBittorrent Connection Settings
- Open qBittorrent and go to **Tools > Options > Connection**.
- Set your **Listening Port** to a high port number (preferably in the 49160-65534 range) to avoid conflicts and ISP blocks.
- If your local router or firewall supports UPnP, enable it in qBittorrent under **Tools > Options > Connection > UPnP**.

## 3. Adjust qBittorrent Settings for Optimal Performance

### 3.1. Speed Settings
- Navigate to **Tools > Options > Speed**.
  - Enable rate limits as needed.
  - Enable the **uTP protocol** to improve connection efficiency.

### 3.2. BitTorrent Privacy Options
- Go to **Tools > Options > BitTorrent** and enable:
  - **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)**
  - **PeX (Peer Exchange)**
  - **Local Peer Discovery**

These settings help expand your pool of peers and seeders, which can boost download speeds.

### 3.3. Optional: Network Interface Binding
- For additional security, you can bind qBittorrent to your VPN's network interface via **Tools > Options > Advanced**.
- Alternatively, use the Network Lock feature available in the ProtonVPN client if supported.

## 4. Testing the Setup

### 4.1. Download a Well-Seeded Torrent
- Open qBittorrent and search for a popular torrent (for example, an Ubuntu ISO).
- Monitor the number of seeders and peers. Optimal performance is typically achieved when the torrent has a high seed-to-peer ratio.

### 4.2. Compare VPN Server Locations
- If speeds are lower than expected, try switching between different ProtonVPN servers or experimenting with different VPN protocols (e.g., OpenVPN vs. WireGuard).

## 5. Additional Optimization Tips

- **Choose a Proper Port:**  
  Avoid ports in the 6881-6999 range. Use a high port (49160-65534) to reduce ISP interference and conflicts.

- **UPnP Considerations:**  
  Since ProtonVPN doesn't support traditional port forwarding, enabling UPnP in qBittorrent may help. However, be mindful of UPnP's security implications.

- **Monitor Internal Settings:**  
  Balance your upload capacity to ensure smooth outgoing communications without hindering download speeds.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If issues arise:
- **Port and Firewall Testing:**  
  Confirm your local firewall and UPnP settings are correctly configured, given ProtonVPN’s lack of port forwarding.
  
- **VPN Stability:**  
  Ensure your ProtonVPN connection is stable and your selected server is not congested.

- **Community Support:**  
  If problems persist, document your system configuration and seek help on relevant forums.
