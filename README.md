## 1. Forwarding a Port for BitTorrent

A properly forwarded port is essential for optimal BitTorrent performance. Follow these steps:

- **Read ProtonVPN's FAQ:**  
  Visit [ProtonVPN Port Forwarding FAQ](https://ProtonVPN.org/faq/port_forwarding/) for detailed instructions on obtaining your forwarded port.

- **Set the Listening Port in qBittorrent:**  
  In qBittorrent, go to **Tools > Options > Connection** and set the "Listening Port" to the port assigned by ProtonVPN.

- **Windows 10 Firewall Configuration:**  
  If you're not using an antivirus or third-party security product, ensure that the Windows Firewall is active (especially on public networks).  
  To add an exception:
  - Open **Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Allowed apps > Allow another app**.
  - Add qBittorrent to the list of allowed applications.

## 2. Configuring qBittorrent Settings

Fine-tuning qBittorrent settings can enhance both speed and privacy:

- **Enable uTP Protocol:**  
  Go to **Tools > Options > Speed/Rate Limit Settings** and enable the uTP protocol.

- **Enable DHT and PeX:**  
  Navigate to **Tools > Options > BitTorrent > Privacy** and ensure that both DHT and PeX are enabled. These features help improve peer discovery and connectivity.

## 3. Optional: Advanced Network Interface Setting

For additional security, you can bind qBittorrent to your VPN's network interface:

- **Set the Network Interface:**  
  In qBittorrent, go to **Tools > Options > Advanced** and set the "Network interface" to the VPN endpoint's name.  
  > **Note:** This is an advanced feature. If you find it confusing, you may simply enable "Network Lock" in the ProtonVPN client (Air Eddie).

## 4. Testing the Setup

After configuring the settings, test your qBittorrent setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Reboot Your Computer:**  
   This ensures that all changes take effect.

2. **Start qBittorrent:**  
   Open qBittorrent and use the search function to look for a well-seeded torrent (e.g., search for "Ubuntu" and choose the torrent with the highest number of seeders).

3. **Monitor Performance:**  
   BitTorrent performance can vary based on the number of trackers, peers, seeders, and their bandwidth. Ensure that your speeds are consistent with your expectations.

## 5. Additional Considerations

- **VPN Server Performance:**  
  Sometimes, congestion may occur between the VPN server and your ISP. If performance issues persist, try switching to a different ProtonVPN server location or experimenting with different OpenVPN protocols.

- **Feedback and Troubleshooting:**  
  If you encounter issues or your setup is not performing as expected, document your system configuration and reach out with detailed information for further assistance.
